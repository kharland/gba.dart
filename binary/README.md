## Overview

This library supports an `Integral` data type for fluent bit manipulation:

```dart
print(uint8.toBinaryPadded(196)); // '11000100'
```

Because of Dart's ability to do advanced *inlining* in both the Dart VM and
dart2js, this library should perform well and be extremely easy to use for most
use cases. For example, it's used in an [`arm7_tdmi`][arm7_tdmi] emulator.

## Usage

This library has a combination of top-level methods, and instance methods of
pre-defined _`Integral` data types_ (see below). For example there are two ways
to _clear_ (set to `0`) a bit:

```dart
// Sets the 0th bit in an (int) bits to 0
bits = clearBit(bits, 0)
```

However, this will _not_ do range validation. Use `Integral#clearBit`:

```dart
// Sets the 0th bit in a uint32 to 0.
// In dev-mode, if either bits or `n` is out of range it throws.
bits = uint32.clearBit(bits, 0);
```
